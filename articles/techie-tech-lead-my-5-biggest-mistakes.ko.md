# 개발자에서 개발팀장이 되기까지 겪은 다섯가지 큰 실수
피터 길라드–모스

젋었을 때는 스스로의 재능에 대한 확신을 가진 야심찬 프로그래머로서, 팀장이 되기를 늘 꿈꿨습니다. 그리고 그렇게 되기까지 4년이 채 걸리지 않았죠. 하지만 2년간 팀을 이끌며 느낀 현실은 제게서 리더쉽이라는 것을 완전히 앗아가버렸습니다. 그 이후로 몇 년 동안 저는 기술의 깊숙한 곳으로 숨어, 더 큰 책임을 요구하는 일에서 도망쳐왔습니다. <sup>(역주: Leader를 팀장으로 의역하였습니다)</sup>

시간이 지남에 따라, 제가 저지른 실수들의 근본적인 원인에 대해 이해하게 되었고,  다시 리더가 되는 기회를 잡아 팀장으로 성장할 수 있었고, 지난 2년간 올바른 지원을 받으며 ThoughtWorks 의 기술 책임자를 맡을 수 있을 정도로 성장하였습니다.

다른 분들에게 도움이 되기를 바라며 제 실수와 실수로부터 배운 것들을 공유해봅니다.

## 1: 기술적인 능력이 리더쉽으로 이어질 줄 알았다
기술 리더 역할을 처음 맡으면서, 젊고 재능있는 졸업생들을 고용했습니다. 우리는 새로운 아이디어와 능력으로 서로 밀어주고 당겨주며 열심히 일했습니다. 고작 몇 달 만에 이 친구들이 경험은 부족할지 몰라도 저보다 기술적으로 더 뛰어날 수 있다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 기술 리더로서 다른 그 누구보다 기술적으로 뛰어남을 증명해야겠다는 생각이 들었습니다. 그들이 다른 사람에게 – 특히 제 보스에게 – 가능성을 보여줄 때마다 저는 불안해져서, 그들이 저보다 제 역할에 더 어울려보이지 않을까 안절부절했습니다. 좋은 동료였던 관계가 제 경쟁심과 불신으로 휩싸였습니다. 그들을 공동 작업자(또는 최소한 잠재적인 후임자)로 여기지 못하고 위협적인 존재로만 여겼습니다.

기술적인 능력이 리더를 선택하는데 있어 가장 큰 요인으로 주로 사용되곤 합니다. 가장 명확하게 보이는 요인이기도 하고요. 이게 제 첫번째 실수였습니다. 기술적으로 뛰어난 사람이 리더로의 능력도 클 것으로 착각했죠.

제 경우에는 이 착각이 별 도움도 안되는 경쟁적인 행동들로 이어졌습니다. 주변 환경과 자격지심 때문에 제 불안은 커져갔습니다. 제 아무리 겸손하고 능력있는 사람이라도 이런 실수는 가면 현상을 강화시켜, 팀의 다른 사람들이 훨씬 가치있다는 생각에 빠지게 만듭니다. 팀웍을 과소평가하거나 스스로의 존재 가치에 대해 의문을 가지게 되기도 합니다. 이런 경우에, 리더는 스스로의 역할을 믿지 못해 우유부단해지고 필요한 순간에 결정을 내리지 못하게 됩니다.

기술이 뛰어난 사람이 리더가 되어야 한다는 이 잘못된 생각 때문에, 능력있는 사람들이 스스로 리더 역할을 꺼려하게 됩니다.


## 2: I focused on tech when I should have broadened my capabilities
I was very excited about my first lead role. It was a brand new team with a greenfield project. I introduced new technologies and practices: unit testing, ORM, continuous integration, pairing, optimistic source control, nant build files. If I read a blog post about an exciting new idea, I incorporated it into our processes and tools.

Choosing tools and technologies was iteration 0 work. Now came the day-to-day stuff. The managing, dealing with stakeholders, representing my team in meetings, performance reviews, recruitment, budgets, etc. And while I knew enough to select svn, nunit, CruiseControl, and C#, I had no idea about all that other stuff.

I began to resent the activities I didn't understand and found difficult. Rather than address my gaps, I focused more on the things I felt I could control: technology. This only aggravated my imposter syndrome, especially if I was in a meeting with other managers who’d confidently talk about growing their teams by bringing in training or making business cases for investment or new team members or disaster recovery plans, etc.

As previously mentioned, technical ability isn’t the only basis for suitability for a leadership role. Alongside technical prowess are many other strengths: from influencing and persuading, to coaching, to understanding processes, to being a trusted advisor, to dealing with complexity, to strategic thinking (and many more). These competencies are much less visible and are probably needed in more nuanced ways throughout the working day and week.

It's important for new leads to understand the significance of these other competencies and the need to build themselves out in breadth across many areas. Otherwise, they risk turning towards their most visible strength — technology — and focus on building depth.

Another trap is that it’s relatively easy for a technologist to build up new technical competencies. We're used to acquiring technical skills; we know the formulas, the blog pages, the StackOverflow posts, the thought leaders to follow, the conferences to attend, the books to read. Given a half decent 'Hello World' example and a few spikes later we're well on our way to picking up a new technology.

But other competencies don't work this way.
 
> There isn't an obvious 'Hello World' for coaching or time management or influencing or persuading or articulating business value.  

We don't know who to follow on Twitter to get the 'right way' to communicate decisions or organize teams or manage stakeholders.

This makes moving into the new domains required for leadership expensive. As many of these domains are relatively new, the lead is left feeling lost and intimidated. They may also mistakenly prioritize developing new technical competencies which are quick and easy to pick up and have obvious value over alien competencies, which are hard to get into without clear value.


## 3: I continued to see myself as an individual producer
After a few months into my first tech lead role, I was becoming increasingly anxious. It seemed like I needed to do a lot of things that didn't feel productive. Less and less of my time was spent pairing and writing code as I was busy in meetings, replying to emails, answering questions from stakeholders, etc. I felt as if every story with my name on it wasn't progressing. My response was to sacrifice my personal time to make up for what I'd missed due to these distractions (as I perceived them). I quickly became overworked.

What I hadn't realized when I moved from a techie to tech lead, was how my responsibilities and metrics for success, in terms of being a producer, had changed. If you look at any delivery team, you can see the main goal is to maximize the amount of 'value' produced. In this light, there are two main activities in the team: those that directly produce value, and those that work to maximize the impact of what is produced. One of the simplest (but by no means the only) ways to do this is to ensure that the producers (in this case the developers) have the maximum time to focus on productive activities (i.e., producing code). The rest of the team, from PM to XD to BA to QA are working to ensure that the flow of work is as correct and smooth as possible and doesn't get blocked or create failure demand (due to bugs, etc.). Simple version: to keep developers productive, the team around them work to remove any obstacles or distractions so developers can focus on writing the right code to deliver value.

When someone moves from techie to tech lead, they’re shifting from being one of the producers to being part of the team whose goal is to maximize overall impact (which includes removing obstacles and blockers).

This misunderstanding places a lot of stress on the new tech lead, especially around time management, specifically a feeling of not having enough time to code or pair with others.  Sometimes this is expressed in frustrations of too many meetings or a desire to have meetings only at certain times (core coding/pairing hours etc.). In some extreme cases, I've seen this manifest as a complete rejection of any activities which were not considered technical (talking to stakeholders for example).  All of these originate from the tech lead's perception of being a direct producer rather than as someone who is maximizing the impact of others.

In my case, it even led to me perceiving myself as the main, and an indispensable, contributor to the team. I've seen this happen a lot with others too, especially in smaller teams where there is a large skills gap between the lead and the other members. Under the combined pressure from additional responsibility along with normal delivery pressures, the tech lead can feel that if they shift away from writing code, the productivity of the team will significantly suffer.


## 4: I wanted to know, and control, everything when I needed to empower others
One day, I was in a meeting when a manager asked about a bug. Having never worked in that area of the application I struggled to answer the question, and the more I tried, the less convincing I became. In the end, for fear of exposing my ignorance, I made an educated guess. It turned out that other teams started making changes in their applications to accommodate my guess and, after wasting a load of effort, they discovered I'd been wrong. I attributed my failure to ignorance and tried to prevent it happening again by reading the commit log at the start of every day.

When reading the commits, I noticed a piece of code that looked rather procedural and I felt could have been more object-oriented. I sat down with the developer and discussed trying a different approach. I decided to pair with them and became absorbed in this small area of the code for several days. At the same time, another pair were working on a significant architectural change. When they released, it caused a bug due to a simple incorrect assumption which I should have picked up.

I was honest with my manager about what had happened; I'd been focusing on getting this code right and missed what the other pair were doing. But I struggled with the feedback that I was worrying about things that weren't important. Surely making sure we were doing OOP code was important? Their response? I needed to pick my battles.

Both these situations had one thing in common: that I couldn't be involved in everything that was happening. It wasn’t humanly possible. As a tech lead, I had to trust others with responsibilities and focus on the most important things. Sometimes that would mean ignorance and other times it would mean that things weren't done exactly the way I would choose to do them, or even that they were done in a less than ideal way.  Saying "I don't know, I need to check with the team" was OK but accidentally spreading misinformation was harmful. And having little things that weren't quite perfect, like a bit of procedural code, was OK. But taking on large architectural change without my oversight was not acceptable. 

I also realized that there are other tools, such as mentoring and running code reviews as a team, which are far more effective in improving the code base over the longer term than trying to fix every small issue, as and when it arose. 


## 5: I didn’t recognize that the signals changed
I'd attend project meetings, suggest improvements, but my frustrations grew as I felt nothing was changing. My contributions didn't seem to turn into anything concrete. We'd discuss having the test teamwork with the developers on each story; we'd try it once and then we'd go back to queuing everything up for pre-prod. People would agree that the developers should own the database, but we'd still wait for the DBAs to build stored procedures. I'd coach developers on TDD but one iteration in, everyone had given up on it. Everything felt like a talking shop where nothing got done, and I felt increasingly frustrated and despondent.

When technology is your every minute of every day, you become attuned to the feedback loops and signals put in place. We’re part of the story wall: our brains release endorphins every time a build passes or story goes to production, and cortisol, when the build breaks or we detect a story, is stuck ‘in development’. But when you move into a leadership role, the signals come from other places.  

It's hard for techies to detect this shift especially as the concerns of each day are mainly the same: stories still need to be picked up and delivered, the code still needs to be written. So the signals a new lead receives still look technical.  

When moving into leadership roles, we need to look out for and learn the other signals. If we want to change direction, we must influence others. We must learn to see the signals that tell us who understands our ideas and whether they’re convinced and supportive or skeptical.  There are also other signals, for instance team members struggling with the workload and needing support; or if they’re missing the tools to develop new skills or disciplines; or there are gaps in communication structures leaving the team ignorant of what it’s supposed to achieve. Often these signals are hard to detect because they come from people — who often hide or mask or highlight other things.
 
> Detecting these signals is almost a sixth sense which you develop with experience, and when you are not attuned to them, you don't even realize they exist.

And they also have to be treated with caution: they may not always be caused by what you think.

The really good leaders seem to be highly attuned to all these signals and understand how to interpret and respond to them. Although it can look like a dark art, akin to reading the tea leaves or animal entrails, there are real rational approaches which, while not as deterministic and certain as technology, are learnable.

One thing you may have noticed is that a lot of these mistakes relate to each other. For example, it’s hard to stop seeing yourself as a producer when you believe your technical ability is your reason for leading. That makes it harder to develop other skills. The way these mistakes fed into each other is what put my leadership journey into a death spiral.

Taking a leadership role is a big change and can be very daunting, and when we, as humans, struggle, we turn to our strengths. And while technical ability needs to form the roots of leadership, we need to grow from our other strengths as well. Whether those are our abilities to work with people, to communicate, convince and persuade others or are technical skills which are transferable such as an ability to learn fast, pick up new things, reason about complex matters or reframe problems in more understandable terms by building abstractions. Once I felt confident in my strengths, I began to see the opportunities to grow new skills and branch out into new exciting areas of learning and development. 

It’s also crucial to understand that the leadership journey isn’t linear.
 
> It’s fine to play a leadership role and move back to pure tech. It will only make you a better technologist. And likewise, leadership is not exclusive to those who carry the label ‘lead’.

Teams should create smaller opportunities for development, without taking a lead role and find ways for others to practice developing the other skills in safer environments.
