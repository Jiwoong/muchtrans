      <p>Every concurrency API needs a way to run code concurrently. Here's some examples of what that looks like using different APIs:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>모든 동시성 API는 코드를 동시에 실행할 수 있는 방법을 필요로 하죠. 서로 다른 API 들이 어떻게 생겼는지 한 번 볼까요.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <pre><code>go myfunc();                                // Golang
pthread_create(&amp;thread_id, NULL, &amp;myfunc);  /* C with POSIX threads */
spawn(modulename, myfuncname, [])           % Erlang
threading.Thread(target=myfunc).start()     # Python with threads

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p>There are lots of variations in the notation and terminology, but the semantics are the same: these all arrange for <code>myfunc</code> to start running concurrently to the rest of the program, and then return immediately so that the parent can do other things.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>다양한 표기법와 서로 다른 용어가 있겠지만, 문법적으로는 모두 같습니다. 모두 <code>myfunc</code>를 프로그램의 나머지 부분과 동시에 실행하려는 것이며, 즉시 돌아와 부모가 나머지 부분을 실행할 수 있도록 하는 것이죠.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p>Another option is to use callbacks:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>다른 방법으로는 콜백을 사용하는 것도 있겠습니다.</p>

document.getElementById("myid").onclick = myfunc;  // Javascript

      <p>Again, the notation varies, but these all accomplish the same thing: they arrange that from now on, if and when a certain event occurs, then <code>myfunc</code> will run. Then once they've set that up, they immediately return so the caller can do other things. (Sometimes callbacks get dressed up with fancy helpers like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all">promise</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">combinators</a>, or <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/servers.html">Twisted-style protocols/transports</a>, but the core idea is the same.)</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>다시 한 번, 표현만 다를 뿐 같은 일을 수행합니다. 지금부터 어떤 이벤트가 발생하면 <code>myfunc</code>를 실행하라는 것입니다. 한 번 설정되고 나면 즉시 되돌아와 부른 쪽에서 다른 일을 할 수 있게 되죠. (콜백이 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all">promise</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">combinators</a>, 또는 <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/servers.html">Twisted-style protocols/transports</a>와 같이 그럴싸해 보이는 형태로도 제공됩니다만, 결국 근간은 같습니다.)</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p>And... that's it. Take any real-world, general-purpose concurrency API, and you'll probably find that it falls into one or the other of those buckets (or sometimes both, like asyncio).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>그리고... 그렇죠. 실제로 사용되는 일반적인 동시성 API를 생각해보더라도 아마 둘중 한 쪽에 속할 겁니다 (가끔 asyncio와 같이 양쪽에 속하는 경우도 있죠).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p>But my new library <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io">Trio</a> is weird. It doesn't use either approach. Instead, if we want to run <code>myfunc</code> and <code>anotherfunc</code> concurrently, we write something like:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>하지만 제가 만든 새 라이브러리인 <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io">Trio</a>는 좀 다릅니다. 어느 쪽에도 해당되지 않죠. 대신, <code>myfunc</code>와 <code>anotherfunc</code>를 동시에 실행하고 싶다면, 아래와 같이 하면 됩니다.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <pre><code>async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
    nursery.start_soon(myfunc)
    nursery.start_soon(anotherfunc)

    <div class="column original">
      <p>When people first encounter this "nursery" construct, they tend to find it confusing. Why is there an indented block? What's this <code>nursery</code> object, and why do I need one before I can spawn a task? Then they realize that it prevents them from using patterns they've gotten used to in other frameworks, and they get really annoyed. It feels quirky and idiosyncratic and too high-level to be a basic primitive. These are understandable reactions! But bear with me.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>"nursery" 구조를 처음 본 사람이라면 이게 뭔가 싶을껍니다. 왠 들여쓰기가 있나? <code>nursery</code> 객체는 또 뭐고, 태스크를 실행하기 위해 왜 이런걸하나? 싶으실 겁니다. 그리고 나서는 다른 프레임워크에서 익숙하게 썼던 패턴을 사용하지 못해 짜증이 나겠죠. 기본 요소라기엔 기이하고 특이하며 너무 상위 수준(high-level)처럼 느껴질 겁니다. 뭐 예상되는 반응입니다! 하지만 좀 참아보세요.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p><strong>In this post, I want to convince you that nurseries aren't quirky or idiosyncratic at all, but rather a new control flow primitive that's just as fundamental as for loops or function calls. And furthermore, the other approaches we saw above – thread spawning and callback registration – should be removed entirely and replaced with nurseries.</strong></p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p><strong>이 포스트를 통해, 저는 nurseries가 기이하지도 이상하지도 않으며, 반복문이나 함수 호출과 같은 근본적인 새로운 흐름 제어 방식임을 알리고자 합니다. 그리고, 위에서 봤던 기존의 방법 – 쓰레드 복제나 콜백 등록 – 들은 nurseries로 완전히 대체되어야 한다고 봅니다.</strong></p>

      <p>Sound unlikely? Something similar has actually happened before: the <code>goto</code> statement was once the king of control flow. Now it's a <a href="https://xkcd.com/292/">punchline</a>. A few languages still have something they call <code>goto</code>, but it's different and far weaker than the original <code>goto</code>. And most languages don't even have that. What happened? This was so long ago that most people aren't familiar with the story anymore, but it turns out to be surprisingly relevant. So we'll start by reminding ourselves what a <code>goto</code> was, exactly, and then see what it can teach us about concurrency APIs.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>이상하게 들리나요? 비슷한 일이 예전에도 있었습니다: 바로 <code>goto</code>가 흐름 제어의 시작과 끝이던 시절이 있었지만, 이젠 <a href="https://xkcd.com/292/">다 흘러간 얘기</a>가 된 것 처럼요. 몇몇 언어들이 아직 <code>goto</code>라 불리는 것을 가지고 있지만 예전에 <code>goto</code>라 불리던 것과 비교하면 다르고 기능이 제한되어 있습니다. 게다가 대부분의 언어에는 아예 없고요. 무슨 일이 있었냐고요? 옛날 옛적 일이라 아는 사람이 별로 없는 이야기지만 놀랄정도로 유사한 이야기입니다. 그럼 이제 <code>goto</code>가 어떤 것이었는지 알아보는 걸로 시작해서 그 이야기가 왜 동시성 API에 대한 얘기로 이어지는지 알아봅시다.</p>

      <p>Let's review some history: Early computers were programmed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly language</a>, or other even more primitive mechanisms. This kinda sucked. So in the 1950s, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">John Backus</a> at IBM and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> at Remington Rand started to develop languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC">FLOW-MATIC</a> (better known for its direct successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>자, 역사를 살펴봅시다. 초기의 컴퓨터는 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">어셈블리 언어</a>나, 그보다 더 기초적인 수단으로 동작했습니다. 아주 거지같았죠. 1950년대가 되서야 IBM의 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">존 배커스</a> 나 Remington Rand의 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">그레이스 호퍼</a> 같은 사람들이 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>과 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC">FLOW-MATIC</a> (그 후속작인 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>이 유명하죠)같은 언어를 개발하기 시작했습니다.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column original">
      <p>FLOW-MATIC was very ambitious for its time. You can think of it as Python's great-great-great-...-grandparent: the first language that was designed for humans first, and computers second. Here's some FLOW-MATIC code to give you a taste of what it looked like:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column translation">
      <p>이 시기의 FLOW-MATIC은 상당히 비범했습니다. 컴퓨터보다는 사람을 중시한 첫번째 프로그래밍 언어로 파이썬의 할머니의 할아버지의 할머니 정도로 여겨도 됩니다. FLOW-MATIC 코드 맛좀 볼까요.</p>

Normally, it was sequential, just like you'd expect: start at the top and move downwards, one statement at a time. But if you execute a special statement like <code>JUMP TO</code>, then it could directly transfer control somewhere else. For example, statement (13) jumps back to statement (2):</p>

<li>Threading libraries usually provide some sort of handle object that lets you <code>join</code> the thread later – but this is an independent operation that the language doesn't know anything about. The actual thread spawning primitive has the control flow shown above.</li>
<li>Registering a callback is semantically equivalent to starting a background thread that (a) blocks until some event occurs, and then (b) runs the callback. (Though obviously the implementation is different.) So in terms of high-level control flow, registering a callback is essentially a <code>go</code> statement.</li>
<li>Futures and promises are the same too: when you call a function and it returns a promise, that means it's scheduled the work to happen in the background, and then given you a handle object to join the work later (if you want). In terms of control flow semantics, this is just like spawning a thread. Then you register callbacks on the promise, so see the previous bullet point.</li>

<li>콜백을 등록하는 것도 문법적으로는 다음과 같은 백그라운드 쓰레드를 시작하는 것과 같습니다. (a) 어떤 일이 발생할 때까지 멈춰있다가, (2) 콜백을 호출합니다. (구현은 완전히 다르게 되겠지만요.) 상위 수준의 흐름 제어로 보자면, 콜백 등록도 <code>go</code> 구문과 동일합니다.</li>
<li>Future와 promise도 마찬가지입니다. promise를 돌려주는 함수를 호출하는 것은 백그라운드로 일어날 일을 예약한다는 것과 같습니다. 그리고 나중에 join할 객체를 – 원한다면 – 돌려줍니다. 흐름 제어 측면에서 보면, 쓰레드를 생성하는 방식과 같죠. 그리고 promise에 콜백을 등록하는 것이니 두 번 말할 것도 없습니다.</li>

      <p>Annoyingly, though, there is no standard name for this category of control flow constructs. So just like "<code>goto</code> statement" became the umbrella term for all the different <code>goto</code>-like constructs, I'm going to use "<code>go</code> statement" as a umbrella term for these. Why <code>go</code>? One reason is that Golang gives us a particularly pure example of the form. And the other is... well, you've probably guessed where I'm going with all this. Look at these two diagrams. Notice any similarities?</p>

      <p>Yep, that's from <em>Notes on structured programming</em>. But his major concern was <em>abstraction</em>. He wanted to write programs that are too big to hold in your head all at once.

Whatever control flow shenanigans a function gets up to internally, other functions don't have to care.</p>

      <p>The fundamental problem with <code>go</code> statements is that when you call a function, you don't know whether it's going to spawn some background task that keeps running after it's finished. With nurseries, you don't have to worry about this: any function can open a nursery and run multiple concurrent tasks, but the function can't return until they've all finished.

      <p>If you have a function that takes a nursery as an argument, then you can pass it one of these instead to control the error-handling policy for the tasks it spawns. Pretty nifty. But there is one subtlety here that pushes Trio towards different conventions than asyncio or some other libraries: it means that <code>start_soon</code> has to take a function, not a coroutine object or a <code>Future</code>. (You can call a function multiple times, but there's no way to restart a coroutine object or a <code>Future</code>.) I think this is the better convention anyway for a number of reasons (especially since Trio doesn't even have <code>Future</code>s!), but still, worth mentioning.</p>

      <p>In Trio, it's possible for code to receive a cancellation request at any time. After a cancellation is requested, then the next time the code executes a "checkpoint" operation (<a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-core.html#checkpoints">details</a>), a <code>Cancelled</code> exception is raised. This means that there's a gap between when a cancellation is <em>requested</em> and when it actually <em>happens</em> – it might be a while before the task executes a checkpoint, and then after that the exception has to unwind the stack, run cleanup handlers, etc. When this happens, the nursery always waits for the full cleanup to happen.

      <p>In Trio, since every task lives inside a nursery, and every nursery is part of a parent task, and parent tasks are required to wait for the tasks inside the nursery... we <em>do</em> have something we can do with unhandled errors. If a background task terminates with an exception, we can rethrow it in the parent task. The intuition here is that a nursery is something like a  "concurrent call" primitive: we can think of our example above as calling <code>myfunc</code> and <code>anotherfunc</code> at the same time, so our call stack has become a tree. And exceptions propagate up this call tree towards the root, just like they propagate up a regular call stack.</p>

      <p>The answer is that when an unhandled exception occurs in a child, Trio immediately cancels all the other tasks in the same nursery, and then waits for them to finish before re-raising the exception.

      <p>And so far, that's been my experience with using nurseries: they encourage clear thinking. They lead to designs that are more robust, easier to use, and just better all around.

      <p>For example, consider the Happy Eyeballs algorithm (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8305">RFC 8305</a>), which is a simple concurrent algorithm for speeding up the establishment of TCP connections. Conceptually, the algorithm isn't complicated – you race several connection attempts against each other, with a staggered start to avoid overloading the network. But if you look at <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...glyph:statemachine-hostnameendpoint">Twisted's best implementation</a>, it's almost 600 lines of Python, and still has <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9345">at least one logic bug</a>. The equivalent in Trio is more than <strong>15x</strong> shorter. More importantly, using Trio I was able to write it in minutes instead of months, and I got the logic correct on my first try. I never could have done this in any other framework, even ones where I have much more experience. For more details, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-R704I8ySE">watch my talk at Pyninsula last month</a>. Is this typical? Time will tell. But it's certainly promising.</p>

      <p>The popular concurrency primitives – <code>go</code> statements, thread spawning functions, callbacks, futures, promises, ... they're all variants on <code>goto</code>, in theory and in practice. And not even the modern domesticated <code>goto</code>, but the old-testament fire-and-brimstone <code>goto</code>, that could leap across function boundaries. These primitives are dangerous even if we don't use them directly, because they undermine our ability to reason about control flow and compose complex systems out of abstract modular parts, and they interfere with useful language features like automatic resource cleanup and error propagation. Therefore, like <code>goto</code>, they have no place in a modern high-level language.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, to fully capture these benefits, we do need to remove the old primitives entirely, and this probably requires building new concurrency frameworks from scratch – just like eliminating <code>goto</code> required designing new languages. But as impressive as FLOW-MATIC was for its time, most of us are glad that we've upgraded to something better. I don't think we'll regret switching to nurseries either, and Trio demonstrates that this is a viable design for practical, general-purpose concurrency frameworks.</p>
