        <p>As a young, ambitious developer with a strong sense of my own talent, I was eager to become a tech lead, and it took less than four years for me to achieve this goal. But over the next two years, the experience and reality of leading a team put me off leadership completely. For several years after, I retreated into the security of the technology, shunning any opportunity to take on more responsibility.</p>

      <div class="column translation">
        <p>젋었을 때는 스스로의 재능에 대한 확신을 가진 야심찬 프로그래머로서, 팀장이 되기를 늘 꿈꿨습니다. 그리고 그렇게 되기까지 4년이 채 걸리지 않았죠. 하지만 2년간 팀을 이끌며 느낀 현실은 제게서 리더쉽이라는 것을 완전히 앗아가버렸습니다. 그 이후로 몇 년 동안 저는 기술의 깊숙한 곳으로 숨어, 더 큰 책임을 요구하는 일에서 도망쳐왔습니다. <sup>(역주: Leader를 팀장으로 의역하였습니다)</sup></p>

        <p>Over time, I gained an understanding of the root causes of my mistakes and eventually regained the confidence to accept new leadership opportunities and grow as a leader, and with the right support over the last two years, I've grown as a Head of Technology inside ThoughtWorks. As I have coached and mentored other leads, I’ve learned that some of my mistakes weren't unique to me but are common among technologists who move into leadership.</p>

        <p>In my first tech lead role, I had hired a talented young graduate. We worked really well together and pushed each other forward into new ideas and skills. Within a few months, I realized that despite their inexperience, they were more technically able than me. As the tech lead, I felt that I had to prove myself as the most technically capable; I’d feel insecure every time they demonstrated their ability to others (especially my managers), concerned that they’d view them as more suitable for my role than I was. What was originally a great working relationship suffered from my feelings of competitiveness and mistrust. Rather than seeing them as a collaborator (or even as a potential successor), I was seeing them as a threat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column translation">
        <p>기술 리더 역할을 처음 맡으면서, 젊고 재능있는 졸업생들을 고용했습니다. 우리는 새로운 아이디어와 능력으로 서로 밀어주고 당겨주며 열심히 일했습니다. 고작 몇 달 만에 이 친구들이 경험은 부족할지 몰라도 저보다 기술적으로 더 뛰어날 수 있다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 기술 리더로서 다른 그 누구보다 기술적으로 뛰어남을 증명해야겠다는 생각이 들었습니다. 그들이 다른 사람에게 – 특히 제 보스에게 – 가능성을 보여줄 때마다 저는 불안해져서, 그들이 저보다 제 역할에 더 어울려보이지 않을까 안절부절했습니다. 좋은 동료였던 관계가 제 경쟁심과 불신으로 휩싸였습니다. 그들을 공동 작업자(또는 최소한 잠재적인 후임자)로 여기지 못하고 위협적인 존재로만 여겼습니다.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column original">
        <p>Someone's technical ability is often one of the biggest factors when choosing them as leaders. It’s also certainly the most visible factor. And here began my first mistake: conflating that ability with the entitlement to lead.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column translation">
        <p>기술적인 능력이 리더를 선택하는데 있어 가장 큰 요인으로 주로 사용되곤 합니다. 가장 명확하게 보이는 요인이기도 하고요. 이게 제 첫번째 실수였습니다. 기술적으로 뛰어난 사람이 리더로의 능력도 클 것으로 착각했죠.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column original">
        <p>In my example, this conflation led to unhelpful competitive behaviours. A lot of my insecurity came from my environment and my mistaken sense of entitlement. But even in the most modest and deserving of people, this mistake can aggravate imposter syndrome, and the lead may perceive other members of the team as more worthy; they may underestimate their teamworkcontributions and struggle to understand their own worth. When this happens, leads can become indecisive and avoid making decisions, rather than trusting those they know to be capable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column translation">
        <p>제 경우에는 이 착각이 별 도움도 안되는 경쟁적인 행동들로 이어졌습니다. 주변 환경과 자격지심 때문에 제 불안은 커져갔습니다. 제 아무리 겸손하고 능력있는 사람이라도 이런 실수는 가면 현상을 강화시켜, 팀의 다른 사람들이 훨씬 가치있다는 생각에 빠지게 만듭니다. 팀웍을 과소평가하거나 스스로의 존재 가치에 대해 의문을 가지게 되기도 합니다. 이런 경우에, 리더는 스스로의 역할을 믿지 못해 우유부단해지고 필요한 순간에 결정을 내리지 못하게 됩니다.</p>

        <p>This mistake prevents good people from putting themselves forward for lead roles, as they believe the most technically competent individual should be the lead.</p>

        <p>기술이 뛰어난 사람이 리더가 되어야 한다는 이 잘못된 생각 때문에, 능력있는 사람들이 스스로 리더 역할을 꺼려하게 됩니다.</p>

        <p>What I hadn't realized when I moved from a techie to tech lead, was how my responsibilities and metrics for success, in terms of being a producer, had changed. If you look at any delivery team, you can see the main goal is to maximize the amount of 'value' produced. In this light, there are two main activities in the team: those that directly produce value, and those that work to maximize the impact of what is produced. One of the simplest (but by no means the only) ways to do this is to ensure that the producers (in this case the developers) have the maximum time to focus on productive activities (i.e., producing code). The rest of the team, from PM to XD to BA to QA are working to ensure that the flow of work is as correct and smooth as possible and doesn't get blocked or create failure demand (due to bugs, etc.). Simple version: to keep developers productive, the team around them work to remove any obstacles or distractions so developers can focus on writing the right code to deliver value.</p>

        <p>This misunderstanding places a lot of stress on the new tech lead, especially around time management, specifically a feeling of not having enough time to code or pair with others.  Sometimes this is expressed in frustrations of too many meetings or a desire to have meetings only at certain times (core coding/pairing hours etc.). In some extreme cases, I've seen this manifest as a complete rejection of any activities which were not considered technical (talking to stakeholders for example).

Having never worked in that area of the application I struggled to answer the question, and the more I tried, the less convincing I became.

Saying "I don't know, I need to check with the team" was OK but accidentally spreading misinformation was harmful. And having little things that weren't quite perfect, like a bit of procedural code, was OK. But taking on large architectural change without my oversight was not acceptable.</p>

        <p>I'd attend project meetings, suggest improvements, but my frustrations grew as I felt nothing was changing. My contributions didn't seem to turn into anything concrete. We'd discuss having the test teamwork with the developers on each story; we'd try it once and then we'd go back to queuing everything up for pre-prod. People would agree that the developers should own the database, but we'd still wait for the DBAs to build stored procedures. I'd coach developers on TDD but one iteration in, everyone had given up on it. Everything felt like a talking shop where nothing got done, and I felt increasingly frustrated and despondent.</p>

        <p>When moving into leadership roles, we need to look out for and learn the other signals. If we want to change direction, we must influence others. We must learn to see the signals that tell us who understands our ideas and whether they’re convinced and supportive or skeptical.  There are also other signals, for instance team members struggling with the workload and needing support; or if they’re missing the tools to develop new skills or disciplines; or there are gaps in communication structures leaving the team ignorant of what it’s supposed to achieve. Often these signals are hard to detect because they come from people — who often hide or mask or highlight other things.</p>

And while technical ability needs to form the roots of leadership, we need to grow from our other strengths as well. Whether those are our abilities to work with people, to communicate, convince and persuade others or are technical skills which are transferable such as an ability to learn fast, pick up new things, reason about complex matters or reframe problems in more understandable terms by building abstractions.
